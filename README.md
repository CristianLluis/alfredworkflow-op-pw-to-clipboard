This Alfred workflow allows you to quickly retrieve a specific password from 1Password using a hotkey. The password is copied to your clipboard, automatically pasted into the frontmost app, and then removed from the clipboard after 10 seconds. It is marked as transient in the clipboard, preventing it from being saved in the clipboard history.

**Variables to Configure:**

1. Sign-in address: e.g., my.1password.com. It can be found under “Manage Account” in 1Password.
2. Secret Reference: You can obtain this by right-clicking on the password in the 1Password GUI

Ensure the 1Password command-line tool (op) is installed and you’re signed into the correct account.
